    <h3>what is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><del><b>Css is not necessary</b></del><span style="background-color: yellow;">
           <b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li style="text-decoration:underline; font-style:italic;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
        
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-style:unset">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal -by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External -by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span style="background-color: yellow;">
            <b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</b></span>, because this is easier to demonstrate,
             and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on
        the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL 
        to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted
        ,a style or a set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target
        elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
